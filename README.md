# salt-jinja-vim
A vim plugin for editing jinja files used with salt.

I hacked this together from various other Jinja2 vim plugin repos, plus some dirty, nasty copy+paste from vim's CSS indent plugin.

It's only here because I needed something to auto-indent this crazy Jinja2 map file I have to edit at work....
